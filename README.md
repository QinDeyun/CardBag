## 🤝Subsequent version optimization
### ⭕Improve campus card identification effect:

  ·Compared with the end - side recognition, the accuracy of cloud - side recognition is higher

  ·Improve the coupling effect of the two components

### ⭕The NFC module is introduced

  In the future, NFC read and simulation function (HCE) will be introduced to enhance the practicability of the platform
  
### ⭕Introduce encryption technology

  Encrypt personal information and card photos and store them in the database
